Before anything else in this project, you need to have boost installed and built. Download the zip file, then unpack. The easiest way to build boost is to use the bootstrap.bat file contained in the download. To use this, open the Visual Studio Developer Console and then run the bat file. (Search the system for dev, it should show up). Once you have run the bat file, then run b2.exe or bjam.exe. This will get everything set up. 


Before the projects is built, it will need to copy its dependancies from the Killer1_Engine into its directory structure. This is the ExLib folder. Directly in the ExLib folder you'll find the .lib files, and a headers directory. 

Here are the command to be run, they were tested manually from the cmd. 


xcopy C:\Projects\Killer1_Engine\Bin\Win32Debug\Killer1_EngineDebug.lib C:\Projects\Killer1_UnitTests\ExLib\ /s /i /y
xcopy C:\Projects\Killer1_Engine\Headers\*.h* C:\Projects\Killer1_UnitTests\ExLib\Headers /s /i /y

I have created a helper script for this called RefreshEngine.bat in Visual Studio. I have run this using a custom command documented in the engine manual itself. 

To run a test: 

1. Create a cpp file with the name of the class of test you are going to run. 

2. Here is an example test: 

#define BOOST_TEST_MODULE VectorTestCases

#include <boost/test/unit_test.hpp>
#include <Atom.h>

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(VectorTestCases) {
	Vector<F32> vectorTest(1.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f);

	BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(vectorTest.x, 5);
	BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(vectorTest.y, 2.0f);
	BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(vectorTest.z, 0.0f);

	delete vectorTest;
}

*All needs to be included!

3. Make sure that you have the project set up correctly. This will save you all kinds of hurt. 
	*Make sure that you are linking to the lib as you should be. 
	*see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2069174/using-boost-test-with-visual-studio
		Make sure that in Visual Studio, under Linker->system you have /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE added.
	*Try to get this down... I don't want to have to learn this every time I need to run a test. 

4. To actually run the test, set the Unit Test project as the start up project, and press ctrl + f5 to run the tests and keep the window open.
